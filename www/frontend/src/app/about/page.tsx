                    My name is Joseph. I am a soon-to-graduate second year student from
                    technical college studying IT Cloud DevOps. I'm attracted to 
                    DevOps because of my love for the automation and optimization aspect. I'm a practical person,
                    and I value effiency. Being able to innovate and create exciting solutions to 
                    real problems that save time is something that feels very rewarding to me.
                    Likewise, with cloud, I excited to work with IaC deployments. What's more
                    is that I truly enjoy working with 

                    I've always been an artist. We all are. I define art as anything made by
                    a human - or group of them for that matter. It sometimes bothers me that
                    modern definitions can fall short in this regard and fail to recognize
                    beauty in this and preclude things that deserve recognition - mass fabricated
                    tools, Even if a
                    machine made it, someone designed the machine, it's just a longer form of
                    artwork where you may only see one piece at a time. 
                    Growing up, I was very much into traditional media - espeically drawing.
                    I started drawing in kindergarten.
                    All through my grade school years I was the class' token artist child. I
                    enjoyed traditional media, I doodled in class, I consumed much
